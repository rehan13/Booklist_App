# MyBookList

MyBookList is a simple web application to manage a list of books. Users can add books by providing the title, author, and ISBN number. The application displays the list of books in a table and allows users to remove books from the list. Data is persisted using the browser's local storage, ensuring that the list of books remains available even after the browser is closed.
